RePLIA - FPGA Based Lock-in Amplifier
-------------------------------------

This software is provided under the terms of the GNU v3 (2007).

The folder marked FPGA contains the relevant files for manipulating the FPGA software. 

If you only wish to use the RePLIA and not make any changes to the FPGA, you can ignore this folder.
Transfer all files from within the RP folder to the /root/tmp folder of the STEMlab.

The LIAControl folder contains all the necessary files for that application. This must remain on the host computer, and requires an up-to-date version of Java. 
Double-click the LIAControl.jar file to begin after installation of the RePLIA on the STEMlab.

Full Instructions can be found in the user manual.
